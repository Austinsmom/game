Tested [v4](https://github.com/matteomenapace/beesness/tree/v4) with 5 primary school children.

### What worked

- Players used drones in an interesting way: instead of targeting only one opponent, they would take honey from 2 or 3
- Replanting mechanic: 1 flower per player + roll the die
- Rotating who starts a round 

### What didn't work

Overall kids were engaged and seemed to be having fun. Drones always spark drama. 

However, converting flowers into honey is not fun, even though it's a core mechanic of the game, as the *market economy*, supply&demand simulation hinges on it. Problems that surfaced around this part of the game:

* Conversion table looked confusing (too many numbers?). It would be good to have separate conversion tables for different numbers of players 
* Semantically, trading flowers for honey is weird (bees don't sell flowers to buy honey, they make honey)
* Semantics aside, even if you buy into this *bees as humans* metaphor, there's something broken in having to  wait for everyone to complete their actions and only then being able to trade flowers for honey. Since the **total number of worker bees** is a pretty good predictor of how many flowers are going to be taken from the garden, we could try to have players trade their flowers for honey during their turn, by using `total workers` instead of `total flowers` as the variable to work out the individual price of a flower. Total workers will vary throughout a round (as people take turn and invest in buying new bees), but this may reveal an interesting dynamic and give the first player in a round a competitive advantage.

### Actions

 - [ ] A `3 honey` note is more useful than the `6 honey` one
 - [ ] State explicitly that honey should be kept visible at all times, you're not allowed to hide it. 
 - [ ] Flower tokens with different colours / graphics can be confusing. Use the same object (eg: chickpeas or so)
 - [ ] Drones can take from different players, not just from one. 
 - [ ] Print bee skills on cards
 - [ ] Starting honey budget: 12 + roll the die (competitive advantage)
 - [ ] Print conversion tables for different player numbers
 - [ ] Try and have players trade their flowers for honey during their turn, by using `total workers` instead of `total flowers` as the variable to work out the individual price of a flower. 

### Ideas for the future

- Sell your bees for 1/3 of their initial price (suggestion from Marco, aka *the strategist*)
- Game ends when you buy your 12th bee? 
- You must have a queen in order to win?
- Event cards, draw one per round and everybody is affected, eg: `Drones can't be used this round` or `Worker bees are striking, you can use no more than one` etc.

#### v5

**Honey** bees (suggestion from Federico) sparked a few ideas for a new game version, which may also feature **trader** bees.
