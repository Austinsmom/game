Prepare all the cards and props, so that you can use them to demonstrate the game as you explain it.

1. Introduce the bees metaphor and the game scenario. Something like 

	> **You play as the director of a beesness**, employing different bees to extract as much value as possible from them, from the natural resources (flowers), and from the market.
2. Explain the goal of the game.

	> Honey is your currency (honey stands for money). Your **goal** is to get to the end of the game (X rounds) with more honey than any other player.
	
	At this point people may ask `how do you make honey` and you can say you'll get to that in a minute. There's one important thing to remember...
3. And it's that `if flowers run low, specifically below the number of players, at any point during the game, then everybody loses, immediately`. Game over, *beesaster*!
4. At this point you can explain the bees in detail.
5. Explain what happens before the round starts (flowers market, bees market and replant the garden)
6. Explain what happens during your turn (use your bees).
7. Explain the referendum to avoid *beesaster*.
8. Let's play!
