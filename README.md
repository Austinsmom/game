# Open Beesness

### A *playable* simulation of a **capitalist market economy** 

As a player, you control a *bee colony*. 

These are special bees. They have learned how to do *beesness* from us humans. 

Every colony operates in the *garden of Commons*.

Throughout the game, you can deploy different *beesness models*: from trading flowers for honey, to stealing other colonies' honey, privatising flowers and other nasty moves..


### Your goal

To have the most **honey** at the end of the year!

#### End game scenarios

1. At the end of the year (12 turns), the colony with the **most honey wins**, provided there are still some flowers left in the *garden*.
* If all flowers are picked from the garden, at any point during the game, **everybody loses**.

## Setup

### How many players? 

From **2** to **infinity**. 

### The garden of Commons

Plant **flowers** in the garden, according to the number of players.

Players			| Flowers
------ 			| -------
2  				| 10
3  				| 15
4  				| 20
5  				| 25
6  				| 30
etc.  			| The formula: 5 × players

### The colony

Each player starts with **1 worker bee**.
 
### The bank 
 
Put all the **honey** in one pot. That will be the **bank**. 

If necessary elect a player who will take care of the honey handling.

### The calendar 

Put a **month marker** (any token) on the first month of the year.

![](assets/calendar.png)

### The colonial cards

Place the **colonial cards** on the side and face up, stacked by type (4 stacks).

Name | Price <sup>honey	| Skills
---- | ----------------	| ------
**Worker** bee <br>![](assets/worker-bee.png) | 4    	| It can **take 1 flower / month** <br>**IF** the garden has more than half of the starting flowers <br> (eg: `if flowers > 10` when there are 4 players) 
**Austerity** bee <br>![](assets/austerity-bee.png) | 8    	| It can **take 1 flower / month** <br>(no matter what)
**Drone** bee <br>![](assets/drone-bee.png) | 8    	| It can **take 2 honey / month** <br> from another colony
**Queen** <br>![](assets/queen.png) | 16   	| It can **generate 1 bee / month** <br>OR<br> **privatise 1 flower / month**


## Gameplay

### Who starts?
	
This is optional (and it doesn't matter who starts the very first turn) but starting a turn may give you a competitive advantage in times of *austerity*... 
	
You can determine the player to start a turn by **bidding honey**. The highest bidder gets the right to execute their *beesness strategy* before all other players. 
	
Play then proceeds *clockwise*.

### Each turn consists of three steps

1. One at a time, you [execute their *beesness strategies*](#1-execute-your-beesness-strategy)
2. All together, you [*trade flowers for honey*](#2-trade-flowers-for-honey)
3. All together, you [replant the garden](#3-replant-the-garden)

### 1. Execute your beesness strategy!

If you have honey, you can invest some (or all) of it to **grow your colony**. You can buy one colonial card per turn by paying its price to the bank.  

Then you use your cards to execute your strategy. You can play from zero cards (but why would you?) to all of them.  
	
**For example**
	
IF	| AND | THEN
-------	| --- | ----
if you have 2 *worker bees* | there are **more than half** of the initial number of flowers in the *garden of Commons* | you can take 2 flowers
you want to use a *worker bee* to take flowers | there are **half or less than half** of the initial number of flowers in the *garden of Commons* | you cannot take flowers with that card
you have 1 *drone* |  | you can take 2 honey from another colony
you want to deploy *drones* against another player | they have less honey than you could take | you can force them to use one or more of their colonial cards as *payment* (eg: put a *worker bee* back to the stack, get 4 honey from the bank and pay you) 	
you have a *queen* |  | you can either **generate** another bee of your choice (that is, pick another card from the stack, any card but not another queen) or **privatise** a flower (that is, keep it in your colony, [more details on this below](#privatise)). You cannot both generate and privatise in the same turn.

### 2. Trade flowers for honey!

Determine the **price of one flower** for this *month* by looking at the price chart line corresponding to the number of **flowers taken by all players** in the garden of Commons.
		
TOTAL FLOWERS | HONEY PER FLOWER
------------- | ----------------
`< 2P` → less than 2 times the number of players (P) <br>eg: `< 8` for 4 players | 3
`2P ⟷ 4P`  	| 2
`> 4P` 			| 1		

![](assets/price-chart.png)

Each player gets an amount of honey equal to the market price multiplied by the number of flowers they took this month. 
	
> For example: if you took 2 flowers and their individual value is 4, then you'll get 8 honey from the bank.
	
Set apart the flowers taken from the garden. 

#### Privatise

If you have a *queen* (and you haven't already used it this month to *generate* a bee), you can keep one flower per month. From the next month, this **privatised** flower will generate more honey for you (at its current market value).

### 3. Replant the garden!

For each 2 remaining flowers, add 1 flower to the garden.

> For example: if there are 9 flowers left, add 4.

<!--
For each colony, add 1 flower to the garden.
> For example: if there are 4 players, add 4. 
-->

#### If flowers are running out... 

All together, you can decide to **give back** one or more of your cards in order to replenish the garden. 

Each *worker*, *austerity* and *drone* bee can get you 1 flower. The *queen* is worth 2 flowers.

You don't have to give back the same number / types of cards. For example, one player may decide to give back 1 bee, and another player 3 bees. Discuss and try to reach a consensus. Remember, if the garden runs out of flowers, everybody loses. 

#### End of the month

Move the month marker to the next space on the calendar to keep track of the turns.

If the marker is on the last month the game ends and the winner is the player with the most honey! Otherwise, a [new month will start](#who-starts).

### Unpacking the metaphors

Just in case you still think this is about *bees*.

Symbol			| Meaning
------ 			| -------
Colony  		| Private company / corporation
Flowers			| The Commons <sup>ideas, raw materials etc.
Honey			| Money
Turns			| Time
Worker bees		| Self-explanatory
Drones			| Military?
Queens			| Growth?
Nectar card		| Competitive advantage

#### What other metaphors can you think of?

Could you *re-skin* this game with a different set of symbols? 

How would that impact the meaning(s) produced during the gameplay?
