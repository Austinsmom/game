# Beesness v11

### AKA *Imbeerialism*, the beesness model of the past. 

This version is inspired by the European colonial empires (16th to 19th century).

The game world is made of 7 hexes. Each player starts from a different one. 

To **win** you must *colonise* at least 3 hexes and hold them for a whole round.

Each player gets:

* 1 Queen
* 1 Drone
* 1 Worker
* 3 honey
* 7 flowers
* 4 large coloured cubes (to mark which hex is under your dominion)
* 3 small coloured cubes (to keep track of your moves)

Each player occupies one of the hexes at the extremities. 

The hexes in the middle axis start unoccupied, with 2 flowers top and bottom, and 4 flowers in the centre one. 

Decide who will be the player starting each round. Play will proceed clockwise. 

> HEADS UP! The player to move last will start with 9 flowers instead of 7.

Set aside all remaining flowers, honey and bee cards. You can put them in a container which you'll call *the Bank*.

You may also need a (smaller) container to collect the small coloured cubes as players make their moves. You can call that *the Box*.


# How to *beehave* <sup>gameplay</sup> 

The game has an indefinite number of rounds (for now!) but I promise that rounds are very short to play :)

1. Each player will carry out **1 move per round**: player 1 makes a move, player 2 makes a move, player 3 makes a move, player 4 makes a move, end of round. 
2. At the end of every third round (rounds 3, 6, 9, 12 etc.) you will **replant the flowers** in every hex. 

### 1. Make your moves

Actions that count as one move:

What? | Which bee? | How? 
----- | ---------- | ----  
**Travel** | Worker, Drone and Queen | Move the bee card from one hex to a contiguous hex, provided both hexes are under your control (ie both hexes have your coloured marker on them). 
**Make honey** | Worker | Pick 1 flower from the hex where the Worker currently stands, and swap it for 2 honey from *the Bank* 
**Trade** | Worker | You can trade honey for flowers, or viceversa. See if any other player wants to trade with you, and negotiate the exchange rate. 
**Invade** | Drone | Remove the previous occupier's marker (large cube) and place your own. Discard the Drone (it died in the invasion). There may be still bees loyal to the previous occupier on the hex you just invaded: you'll need to wait for the next round to either kill or enslave them. You won't *hold* a hex until there are only your bees on that hex. The good thing is that foreign bees can't travel back to their hexes, but they can still operate (make honey, trade, kill your bees or regain control of the hex etc.) 
**Kill** | Drone | You can annihilate another bee currently operating in a hex you control (provided the Drone is currently in the same hex). Discard the Drone and the bee it killed.
**Enslave** | Queen | You can trade foreign bees back to their hexes (provided that they're in the same hex as your Queen).
**Generate** | Queen | You can generate a Worker for 1 honey or a Drone for 2 honey. Place them on the same hex as the Queen.

After each move, place one of your 3 mini cubes in *the Box*, to keep track of how many moves you have left before replanting the garden.

You can repeat the same move round after round if you like.

### 2. Replant the flowers

Flowers represent *natural resources*, which get replenished periodically (provided they're not completely depleted) and are used to feed the bees. Hexes with many bees and few flowers will deplete quickly, while hexes with few/no bees and many flowers will flourish.

Use the formula `current flowers divided by 2 (round up) minus the number of bees currently occupying the hex`.

Flowers | Growth 
------- | ------
0 | 0
1-2 | 1
3-4 | 2
5-6 | 3
7-8 | 4
etc.

For example: if one of your hexes has 7 flowers and 3 bees, the formula will be `7/2 (round up) - 3`, ie `4 - 3` so you'll replant 1 flower.

After replanting the flowers each player can pick their 3 mini cubes back and start the next round.

### **Beesness** is a game for 3-5 players that simulates a *capitalist market economy*. 

A *beesness* is a business for bees. 

Not your usual bees. In this game, bees have learned how to do business from us humans: they can **trade** flowers for honey and honey for more bees. 

**You** play the director of one beesness in times of *scarcity*. You compete against other players over **bees** (labour), **flowers** (resources) and **honey** (money). 

**To win**, your beesness must end the game with **more honey** than any other beesness. 
 
Your beesness operates in the `Garden of Commons`. If its flowers run out, at any point during the game, **everybody loses** immediately! You can avoid this tragedy by **calling a referendum** to replant flowers.

Will you manage to maximise your honey profits while preventing a collective *beesaster*?


# How to *beegin* <sup>setup</sup>

These instructions are for 4 players: P1, P2, P3 and P4. If you play with 3 or 5 players, you will have to adjust the number of *flowers* and the amount of *honey* in the `Honeypot` (more on that below).

![](assets/setup.png)

### 1. Flowers

Flowers are the *natural resources* you can extract and sell. 

Plant **7 flower tokens** per player (28 in total in a 4-player game) in the `Garden of Commons` which grows at the centre of the table. 

Give **2 flower tokens** to each player.

### 2. Bees

Bees are the *labour* you can employ.

You will need a total of **10 workers** (W), **10 drones** (D) and **4 queens** (Q).

Each player starts with 2W, 2D and 1Q.

Put the remaining 2W and 2D in the `Bee Market`.

Type | Action | Full-time or freelance?
---- | ------ | ----------------
**Worker** <br><br>![](assets/worker-bee.png) | **Pick flowers** from the garden. | Freelance. This means you use it for one job. After that, the bee goes to the `Bee Market`, where it can be hired by you or other players.
**Drone** <br><br>![](assets/drone-bee.png) | **Sell flowers** for honey. | Freelance
**Queen** <br><br>![](assets/queen.png) | **Hire bees** throughout the game. Gamble on honey on the last round. | Full-time.  This bee remains with you, it doesn't go to the `Bee Market` after a job.

### 3. Honey

Honey is *money*.

Each player picks a colour token and places it on the `Honeycomb` at 6. 

That means your initial capital is **6 honey**. 

### 4. Honeypot

The `Honeypot` represents the *consumer market*. How much are *consumers* willing to spend at each round, ie how big is the `Honeypot`, will depend on two factors:

1. Flowers left in the game (both those  in the garden and those picked by players) 
2. Honey invested by players in hiring bees

In a 4-player game, the `Honeypot` starts at 36. 

When dividing the `Honeypot`, always round up.

### 5. Round tracker

This helps you keep track of the rounds. Put a marker over the first round.

There will be **9 rounds**.
 

# How to *beehave* <sup>gameplay</sup> 

The bee cards in your hand are kept **secret**, and you play **one card per round**.

Decide which card to play, place it **face-down** on the table and when everyone is ready, **reveal your choices simultaneously**.

You will carry out the chosen bee actions in this order:

1. Workers
2. Drones
3. Queens

When there are 2+ players going for the same bee, **the player with the least honey goes first**.

### 1. Workers

You can pick **3 flowers** if you're the only one playing the worker card. 
	
Subtract 1 flower for each other player that also played this card. 
	
> For example, if 2 players play the worker, they can pick 2 flowers each. Also, if all players play the worker, nobody will get any flowers.

Workers are free-lance, so after you used one put it in the `Bee Market`. 

### 2. Drones

You can trade (some of) your flowers for honey from the `Honeypot`.

The flowers you trade will be discarded, and the honey you gain from the trade will be added to your capital in the `Honeycomb`.

If two or more players chose the drone card, then they will enter a **blind bid** to split the `Honeypot`. Put the flowers you want to trade in your hand. Without revealing them, place your closed fist at the centre of the table (even if you're not trading any flowers). When everyone is ready, open your hands to show how many flowers you are trading. Count the flowers everyone is trading, and divide the `Honeypot` accordingly. Always round the number up if the division is not a whole number.

> For example: the Honeypot contains 30 honey and the total number of flowers traded is 3. Each flower will be worth 10 honey (30/3). Let's say you are trading 2 of those 3 flowers, so you get 20 honey from the `Honeypot`. Move your counter on the `Honeycomb` 20 steps ahead, the other trader's counter by 10 steps, and reset the `Honeypot` marker to 0.
	
If you're the only one playing the drone card, then you get all the honey in the `Honeypot`! Discard one of your flowers, and **donate** another one of your flowers back to the `Garden` (it's an *ethical drone*).

Drones are free-lance, so after you used one put it in the `Bee Market`.

### 3. Queens
 
You can hire **3 bees** from the `Bee Market` if you're the only one playing the worker card. 
	
Subtract 1 bee for each other player that also played this card. 

> For example, if 2 players play the queen, they can hire (up to) 2 bees each. Also, if all players play the queen, nobody will be able to hire any bees. 

The **starting price** of every bee is the current number of rounds. So bees start at 1 honey during the first round and by the 9th round they are worth 9 honey.

When 2+ players want the same bee, they will enter an **auction** for it. The player with the least honey can start the auction. Players interested in that bee have to offer at least 1 honey more than the last offer. 

To **hire a bee**, subtract its price in honey from your counter on the `Honeycomb` and add the same amount into the `Honeypot`.

> For example, you currently hold 9 honey and the `Honeypot` is at 0. You're paying 3 honey for a bee, so your counter goes down to 6 and the `Honeypot` goes to 3. 

## Prepare the next round

**Recharge** the `Honeypot` with the number of flowers left in the game (flowers in the garden + flowers picked by players).

> For example, if there are 20 flowers left in the garden and 10 flowers held by players, then move the `Honeypot` counter forward by 30.

Move the marker to the next space on the **round tracker**. 

## Last round!

Predictably, on the last round everyone would want to use a drone card and sell  flowers to maximise their honey profits. There would be no point in picking flowers with a worker (there will be no chances to sell them after the game is over), or to hire more bees. 

However, the last round is special! The Queen becomes a *gambler*: if you use it, then you get to **roll the die** as many times as you have flowers. You get as much honey for each roll as the die says.


# How to win

### At the end of the last round, **the player with the most honey wins!**



# How not to lose

### If flowers run out, at any point during the game, everybody loses *immediately*.

To avoid this *beesaster* (and to prevent other players from killing the game by taking the last flower) anyone can **call a vote to replenish the garden** at any point during the game.

`Are you willing to donate one of your bees in exchange for 2 new flowers?` 

**You get 1 vote for each of your bees**. For example, if you have a total of 5 bees, you get 5 votes.

* If there's a **majority of Yes** votes then *everyone* will discard one of their cards (any card) and add 2 new flowers to the garden. For example, in a 4-player game you would add 8 new flowers to the garden and set the 4 cards aside (not in the Bee Market, these cards won't get back in the game).
* Otherwise, no flowers are replanted this turn.


# Sticky situations <sup>FAQs</sup>   

1. **Do my bees count at the end of the game?**

	**No**. It's just the honey you have (that is, your *profits*) and not the overall *valuation* of your beesness. 
2. **Can I make alliances with other players?**

	Sure, why not? The terms of your trade agreements are up to you. 
3. **Can I lend honey to other players?** 

	Yas. As long as you trust them to pay their debt back...
4. **I'm in a rush, can we play a shorter game?** 

	Yep. You can shorten the game by playing less rounds.
