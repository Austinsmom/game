# Bees: freelance and employees

Freelance bees do their work for you once and then you discard them. Employee bees keep working for you for the rest of the game.

Type | Price | Action | Discard or keep?
---- | ----- | ------ | ----------------
**Drone** <br><br>![](assets/drone-bee.png) | **3** honey | Roll the die and then **steal as much honey as the die says** from another beesness. | Discard
**Worker** <br><br>![](assets/worker-bee.png) | **6** honey | **Pick 1 flower** from the garden. | Keep
**Queen** <br><br>![](assets/queen.png) | **12** honey | Roll the die and then **save as much honey as the die says**. This means that drones won't be able to steal that honey. Place the saved honey on top of your Queen card. | Keep
