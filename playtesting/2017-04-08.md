# 2p - v4

Tested [v4](https://github.com/matteomenapace/beesness/tree/v4) with Aimee.

### What went well

- Printed cards and wood tokens feel good.
- *Stalk exchange* mechanic creates excitement. `What's it gonna beee?`
- Drones create drama (we knew that already, but hey)

### Even better if...

- Drones seem too powerful. There is no risk involved in using them, apart from the threat of retaliation from other players. In a 2-player game, you may end up buying drones just to pass honey back and forth from each other
- The *stalk exchange* is rather predictable in a 2-player game.

## Actions

- [ ] Try **chance cards**, to be drawn each time you use a drone. These could either reward or penalise you. For example, penalising chance cards could be: 
	- miss a turn
	- only steal 2 honey (or give 1 back)
	- only steal 1 honey (or give 2 back)
	- steal no honey
	- give honey to the bank
	- destroy flowers from the garden
	- give some of your flowers back
	Rewarding chance cards could be:
	- steal 4
	- steal 5
	- steal 6
	- get extra 1, 2 or 3 honey from the bank
	- steal also a flower

- [ ] Add **extra price tiers** to the *stalk exchange*

	total flowers | price per flower
	------------- | ----------------
	< P <br>P = number of players | 6
	P ... 2P - 1 | 5
	2P ... 3P - 1 | 4
	3P ... 4P - 1 | 3
	4P ... 5P - 1 | 2
	5P ... 6P - 1 | 1
	
	With P = 4
	total flowers | price per flower
	------------- | ----------------
	0 ... 3 | 6
	4 ... 7 | 5
	8 ... 11 | 4
	12 ... 15 | 3
	16 ... 19 | 2
	20 + | 1
