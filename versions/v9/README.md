# Beesness v9

*The cooperative version*.

* Players play cards from their hands that attach to their character, giving their character a limiting condition.
* Instead of playing as the bosses of a beesness, this version asks you to play a lowly worker/drone/queen bee, who will accrue limiting conditions. 
* Player-characters start with full honey, and, as the game goes on, consume their honey. If any character runs out of honey, that character dies, and the game ends in a loss (similar to [Forbidden Desert](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136063/forbidden-desert)). Group gameplay changes in reaction to individual characters’ honey levels, as characters can carry and distribute honey, bringing some characters back from the brink of death, but at the expense of making progress towards the game’s other goals.
* Can we have *mission* and *support* phases like in [The Grizzled](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/171668/grizzled)? If the *mission* phase is like a negative-outcome set-collection game, then the *support* phase is like a social deduction game where, instead of trying to conceal your intentions, you are trying to get (or keep) the group on track, while being expressly prohibited from communicating.
