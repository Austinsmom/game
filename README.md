# Beesness

### A playable simulation of a *capitalist market economy* 

As a player, you control a **colony of bees**. 

These are special bees. They have learned how to do *beesness* from us humans. 

Every colony operates in the **garden of Commons**.

Throughout the game, you can experiment with different *beesness plans*: from **trading** flowers for honey, honey for bees, to **extorting** honey from other colonies, **privatising** flowers and other nasty moves...

### Your goal

To have the most *honey* at the end of the year!

#### End game scenarios

1. At the end of the year (12 rounds), the player with the **most honey wins**, provided there are still flowers left in the *garden*.
* If all flowers are taken from the garden, at any point during the game, **everybody loses**.

## Ingredients

* 2+ [human players](#how-many-players)
* A [table](#the-garden-of-commons) 
* Flower tokens (roughly 10 for each player)
* [Honey tokens](#the-honey-pot-bank) 
* [Bee cards](#meet-the-bees)
* Flower - honey [price chart](#2-sell-your-flowers-for-honey)
* Turns tracker (aka the [calendar](#the-calendar)) 
* A 6-sided die 

### How many players? 

From **2** to **infinity**. 

### The garden of Commons

Plant **flowers** in the garden. To start with, place 6 flower tokens for each player on the table.

Players	| Flowers
------ 	| -------
2       | 12
3       | 18
4       | 24
5       | 30
6       | 36
etc.    | The formula: 6 Ã— players

### The honey pot bank 
 
Put all the **honey** in one pot (or pile). That will be the **bank**. 

### The colony

Each player starts with an initial capital of **12 honey**. On top of that 12, each player **rolls the die** and gets as much honey as the die says. This could bring your initial capital to 18 honey! :game_die:

### Meet the bees

Place the **bee cards** face up, stacked by bee type.

Type | Price <sup>honey	| Skills
---- | ----------------	| ------
**Worker** bee <br><br>![](assets/worker-bee.png) | **6** | It can **take 1 flower per month** from the garden. At the end of each round, you trade flowers for honey. 
**Drone** bee <br><br>![](assets/drone-bee.png) | **12** | It can **take 3 honey per month** from other colonies (in different combinations, eg: 3 honey from 1 colony, 1 honey from 3 different colonies, 2 from 1 colony and 1 from another)
**Queen** bee <br><br>![](assets/queen.png) | **18** | It can **privatise 1 flower per month**. Privatising means you can keep flowers (instead of trading them) and still get paid. 

### The calendar 

Put a **month marker** (any token) on the first month of the year.

## Method

### Who starts the round?

There are two ways to decide this:

1. By **bidding honey**, aka *beedding*. The highest *beedder* pays the bank and gets the right to execute their *beesness plan* before all other players.
	
	If you wish, you can *beed* to start at the beginning of every round.
2. If nobody wants to *beed*, then you will **rotate the starting player**. If you started this round, the player to your left will start the next.

Play proceeds **clockwise**.

### There are three steps to every round

1. One player at a time, you [execute your *beesness plan*](#1-execute-your-beesness-plan)
2. All together, you [sell your flowers for honey](#2-sell-your-flowers-for-honey)
3. All together, you [replant the garden](#3-replant-the-garden)

### 1. Execute your beesness plan!

#### Invest

If you have honey, you can decide to invest some (or all) of it to **grow your colony**. 

You can buy as many bee cards as you can afford. 

Pay the bank and add the card(s) to your colony.  

#### Deploy

Deploy as many of your cards as you wish. 

You can deploy newly acquired bees immediately (no need to wait for the next round).

> For example

> If you have 2 ***workers***, you can take 2 flowers.

> If you have 1 ***drone***, you can take 3 honey from another colony.

> If you want to deploy ***drones*** against another player but they have less honey than you could take, you can force them to use one or more of their bee cards as *payment* (eg: put a *worker bee* back to the stack, get 6 honey from the bank and pay you). 

> If you use **drones** to pillage another colony, you have to wait for your next turn to invest the loot.
 	
> If you have a **queen**, you can **privatise** (keep) one of the flowers taken by your workers. From the next month, this privatised flower will generate more honey for you at its current market value. 

#### Can I sell bees?

You are not allowed to make bees *redundant*, i.e. selling them back to the bank.

You can **trade bees with other players** though. See if anyone is interested in your bees and negotiate a price.

### 2. Sell your flowers for honey!

After all players have executed their *beesness plans*, you can trade your flowers for honey.

The maximum you can get for a flower is 3 honey, when only a few flowers have been taken from the garden. The more flowers, the less they are valued on the market (aka [*supply&demand*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand)).

To determine the **price of one flower** for this *month*, count **how many flowers have been taken from the garden by all players** this round and check the *price chart* corresponding to the number of players.
 
Each player gets paid in honey, from the bank, for the flowers they took this month. 
	
> For example: if you took 2 flowers and their individual value is 3, then you'll get 6 honey from the bank.
	
Your flowers are now sold. Discard them. 

#### Privatise

If you have a *queen*, you can **keep one flower per month and still get paid for it**. From the next month, this privatised flower will generate more honey for you at its current market value.

Privatised flowers don't count when working out the flowers' price at the end of a round. 

> For example: you have taken 2 flowers from the garden this round and you have 1 privatised flower from the previous round. Only flowers taken from the garden count to determine the price per flower, so you count for 2. Let's say 10 flowers were taken from the garden this round and there are 4 players, so each flower is worth 2 honey. You will get 4 honey for the flowers you took, plus 2 for the privatised one: 6 honey in total. 

### 3. Replant the garden!

At the end of the round, **replant one flower per player**. Then **roll the die** and replant as many flowers as the die says. :game_die:

> For example: if there are 4 players, add 4 flowers to the *garden*. Then roll the die: it's a 2, so you add another 2 flowers.

#### If flowers are running out... 

Remember, **if the garden runs out of flowers, everybody loses.**

All together, you can decide to **give back** one or more of your bee cards in order to replenish the garden. 

Each *worker* and *drone* bee can get you 1 flower. The *queen* is worth 2 flowers.

You don't all have to give back the same number or type of cards. For example, one player may decide to give back 1 bee, and another player 3 bees. Discuss and try to reach a consensus. 

#### End of the month

Move the month marker to the next space on the calendar to keep track of the rounds.

### End of the game

The game ends at the end of the last month. 

**The player with the most honey wins!**

#### Does my bees arsenal count at the end of the game?

No. It's just the honey you have (that is, your *profits*) and not the overall valuation of your colony.
