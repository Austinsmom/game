# Beesness

![](assets/bees.png)

**Beesness** is a competitive / cooperative game for 2+ players that simulates a *capitalist market economy*. 

As a player you control a *beesness*. These peculiar bees have learned how to do business from us humans: they can *trade* flowers for honey and honey for other bees, they can *extort* honey from other beesnesses and even employ *cheap labour*. **To win** you must end the year with **more honey** than any other beesness. This is the **competitive** part.

Every beesness operates in the **garden of Commons**. If all flowers are taken from the garden, at any point during the game, **everybody loses** immediately. To avoid this tragedy, you can **cooperate** with the other beesnesses to replant flowers.

Will you manage to maximise your honey profits while avoiding *drone strikes* and a collective *beesaster*?



# How to *beegin* <sup>setup</sup>

![](assets/setup.png)

1. Place the **beesness cards** `1` face up, stacked by bee type.
2. Put all the **honey** `2` in one pot (or piles). That will be the **bank**. 

	Each player starts with **12 honey** plus a **roll of the die** `5`. This could bring your starting capital to 18 honey! :game_die:
3. Pick the flowers-honey **price chart** `3` corresponding to the number of players and put it next to the honey-pot bank. 
4. Place the round tracker cards `4` (the **calendar**) next to the price chart and put the die over the first month (1).
5. *Plant* **6 flower tokens** `6` for each player on the table. It doesn't matter which colour flowers are.

	> For example: if there are 4 players, plant 24 flowers. 



# How to *beehave* <sup>gameplay</sup> 

### Players take turns, going *clockwise* :alarm_clock: around the table.


## Who starts the round?

There are two ways to decide this:

1. By **bidding honey**, a.k.a. *beedding*. The highest *beedder* pays the bank and gets the right to execute their *beesness plan* before all other players.
	
	If you wish, you can *beed* to start at the beginning of every round.
2. If nobody wants to *beed*, then you will **rotate the starting player**. If you started this round, the player to your left will start the next.


## On your turn

### At the beginning of your turn you can **buy beesness cards** to grow your beesness. Then you can use your beesness cards to **execute your beesness plan**.

1. **Buy beesness cards**! 

	If you want and can afford their price, you *can* buy one or more beesness cards. 
	
	Pay the bank the price for each card in honey and add the card(s) to your beesness. 
2. **Execute your beesness plan**!  

	Every beesness card has a skill. Use as many of your cards as you like. 

	You can deploy newly acquired bees immediately, there's no need to wait for the next round.
	
	> For example: you have 2 workers, 1 drone and 1 queen. You could use your queen to buy an extra drone at half price. Then use your 2 workers to pick 2 flowers (1 flower each) and use your drones to steal up to 6 honey from other beesnesses (n any combination).


##Â At the end of a round

## When all players have executed their *beesness plans*, the bank opens the **stalk exchange** and you have 1 minute to trade your flowers (as many as you want) for honey. Then you **replant the garden** and move to the next round.

1. **Trade flowers on the stalk exchange**!

	The maximum you can get for 1 flower is 3 honey, when only a few flowers are traded. The more flowers on the market, the less they are worth (a.k.a. [*supply&demand*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand)).
	
	You have 1 minute to decide how many flowers to put on the stalk exchange. Everybody does this at the same time. 
	
	Put as many flowers as you want to trade (from none to all) in your hand. Without revealing them, place your close fist at the centre of the table. When everyone is ready, open your hands to show how many flowers you are trading.

	Check the **price chart** to determine the **price of one flower**.
 
	You get paid in honey, from the bank, for the flowers you are trading. 
	
	> For example: if you are trading 2 flowers and their individual price is 3 honey, you get 6 honey from the bank.

	Your flowers are now sold. Discard them.

2. **Replant the garden!**

	Replant **one flower per player**. Then **roll the die** and replant as many flowers as the die says. :game_die:

	> For example: if there are 4 players, add 4 flowers to the *garden*. Then roll the die: it's a 2, so you add another 2 flowers.
3. Move the month marker to the next space on the calendar to keep track of the rounds.

# Meet the bees

Type | Price <sup>honey	| Skills
---- | ----------------	| ------
**Worker** bee <br><br>![](assets/worker-bee.png) | **6** | It can **take 1 flower per month** from the garden. At the end of each round, you can trade flowers for honey. 
**Drone** bee <br><br>![](assets/drone-bee.png) | **12** | It can **take up to 3 honey per month** from other beesnesses (in different combinations, eg: 3 honey from 1 beesness, 1 honey from 3 different beesnesses, 2 from 1 beesness and 1 from another, etc.)
**Queen** bee <br><br>![](assets/queen.png) | **18** | It can you can **buy other beesness cards at half their normal price**. 

### Anatomy of a beesness card

![](assets/anatomy.png)



# How to win

### The game ends at the end of the last month (12). **The player with the most honey wins!**



# How not to lose

### If the garden runs out of flowers, everybody loses *immediately*.

To avoid this *beesaster*, you can decide all together to **give back** one or more of your beesness cards in order to replenish the garden. 

Each beesness card can get you 1 flower. 

You don't all have to give back the same number or type of cards. For example, one player may decide to give back 1 bee, and another player 3 bees. Discuss and try to reach a consensus. 

Put the cards you are sacrificing onto their stack next to the bank and replant the garden with the corresponding number of flowers.



# Sticky situations (FAQs)   

1. **Can I sell bees?**

	**No**. You are not allowed to sell your bees back to the bank. You can however **trade bees with other players**: see if anyone is interested in your bees and negotiate a price.
	
	<!-- You cannot dismiss bees. You can only make them redundant if you're being attacked by a drone and don't have enough honey -->
2. **Do my bees count at the end of the game?**

	No. It's just the honey you have (that is, your *profits*) and not the overall *valuation* of your beesness. 
3. **Can I make alliances with other players?**

	Sure, why not? The terms of your trade agreements are up to you. 
4. **What if I use my drone(s) against a beesness that has not enough honey?**

	You can force them to use one or more of their beesnesses cards as *payment* (eg: put a *worker bee* back to the stack, get 6 honey from the bank and pay you).
5. **Can I use a drone and buy more beesness cards with the loot?**

	Not during the same turn. You'll have to wait your next turn to invest your loot into new beesness cards.
