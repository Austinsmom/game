# v8.1

Like [v8](README.md), but:

* Start with 1 worker and 6 honey.
* There are 6 cards per bee type, plus the extra workers that each player starts with (eg: in a game of 4 players, there will be 10 workers, 6 drones and 6 queens)
* Bees generated by the queen are flipped face-down at first, and can only be used from the next round.
* You can sell one flower by default, and each drone allows you to sell an extra flower on top (1 flower per drone).
* Bee market: there will be only one auctions per player, rotating the player who starts bidding (eg: 4 auctions in a game of 4 players).  
* You get an extra auction for each worker or drone that you haven't used during the previous round.
* We could keep track of the auctions by giving players auction tokens (eg: little black cubes).
