You start with *workers* only.

You have two Bessness models:

1. **Cooperative**: democratic / chaotic, with less player control but more *rewards*. In referendums, they would vote with a coin toss (random).   
2. **Corporation**: hierarchy, more control but less rewards (eg: you have to pay your workers a salary, whereas in the cooperative workers own it)

You can attack other beesnesses but you sacrifice that worker.

There will be technology/skills cards that allow you to upgrade your workers.
